Not the kind who battled dragons or discovered lost cities, mind you. Barnaby's adventures were usually confined to the wild, untamed jungle of his own backyard.\n","\n","One sunny morning, a glint of something unusual caught Barnaby's eye near the ancient oak tree. It was a tiny, shimmering feather, unlike any he'd ever seen. It was the colour of a rainbow after a summer shower, with hints of emerald green and sapphire blue.\n","\n","\"A treasure!\" Barnaby whispered, his heart thumping with excitement. He carefully picked it up. It felt soft and strangely warm in his fingers. \"This must belong to a very special bird!\"\n","\n","His mission was clear: find the owner of the rainbow feather. He grabbed his trusty magnifying glass (essential for any serious explorer) and his trusty sidekick, a fluffy, ginger cat named Marmalade, who mostly enjoyed napping in sunbeams but occasionally batted at interesting bugs.\n","\n","Barnaby started his expedition at the base of the oak. He scanned the bark for clues, imagining tiny footprints or discarded seeds. Marmalade, meanwhile, was engrossed in a fierce battle with a dandelion puff.\n","\n","\"Anything, Marmalade?\" Barnaby asked, though he knew Marmalade was more interested in fluff than feathers. Marmalade responded with a lazy yawn.\n","\n","Undeterred, Barnaby ventured deeper into the \"Emerald Jungle,\" as he called the overgrown rose bush. He pushed aside prickly branches, his eyes peeled for any sign of unusual colour. He imagined the bird to be shy, perhaps hiding amongst the dense foliage.\n","\n","Suddenly, a flash of iridescent colour zipped past his nose! Barnaby gasped. It was a tiny hummingbird, its wings a blur, hovering near a bright red fuchsia. It was too fast to get a good look, but Barnaby was sure he saw a hint of rainbow shimmer.\n","\n","\"That's it!\" he exclaimed. \"The rainbow bird!\"\n","\n","He followed the hummingbird, his heart pounding with anticipation. It flitted from flower to flower, a tiny jewel against the green. Barnaby, trying to be as quiet as a stalking tiger, crept along the garden path.\n","\n","The hummingbird led him to the far corner of the garden, where a small, bubbling bird bath stood. And there, perched on the edge, was the most magnificent bird Barnaby had ever seen. It was small, no bigger than his thumb, but its feathers shimmered with every colour imaginable. It dipped its beak into the water, and as it tilted its head, the sunlight caught its plumage, making it glow.\n","\n","Barnaby held his breath. He didn't want to scare it. He slowly, ever so slowly, reached into his pocket and pulled out the shimmering feather. He held it out, a silent offering.\n","\n","The rainbow bird turned its head, its bright, intelligent eyes meeting Barnaby's. It chirped a soft, melodious tune, a sound like tiny bells. Then, it hopped closer, took the feather from Barnaby's outstretched finger with its delicate beak, and tucked it neatly amongst its own dazzling feathers.\n","\n","Barnaby beamed. He had found the owner! The bird gave him one last, happy chirp, and then with a whir of its rainbow wings, it soared into the sky, a breathtaking streak of colour against the blue.\n","\n","Barnaby watched until it was just a tiny speck. He felt a warmth spread through him, a feeling of accomplishment and wonder. His backyard adventure had led him to something truly magical.\n","\n","He turned to Marmalade, who had finally decided the dandelion battle was over and was now grooming himself meticulously. \"Marmalade,\" Barnaby announced, puffing out his chest, \"we had a truly magnificent adventure today!\"\n","\n","Marmalade blinked slowly, then nudged Barnaby's hand with his head, as if to say, \"Yes, and now it's time for a nap.\"\n","\n","Barnaby chuckled. He knew that even if Marmalade didn't quite understand, his own heart was full of the joy of discovery. And he couldn't wait for his next adventure in the wild, untamed jungle of his backyard.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### For 2 input variables = {\"genre\":\"Adventure\",\"years\":10}"],"metadata":{"id":"zCRUBcOnE10G"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["runn2_cpt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(\"You are having a {years} years of experience in writing and generating a story for children's\"),\n","                                  HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(\"Based on this genre: {genre} generate a story\")])"],"metadata":{"id":"rLntcIth-DdO","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1771391800737,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1,"user":{"displayName":"Shrutika Kapade","userId":"07496277854067889905"}}},"execution_count":76,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["sequential_chain_2 = RunnableSequence(runn2_cpt,runn2_model,runn3_strp) # Another way to mension = runn2_cpt|runn2_model|runn3_strp"],"metadata":{"id":"hgO_qKXO-DaQ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1771391800739,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1,"user":{"displayName":"Shrutika Kapade","userId":"07496277854067889905"}}},"execution_count":77,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["response_2 =sequential_chain_2.invoke({\"genre\":\"Adventure\",\"years\":10})\n","# here we pass 2 inputs"],"metadata":{"id":"e1ixxZ3B-DXS","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1771391807755,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":7006,"user":{"displayName":"Shrutika Kapade","userId":"07496277854067889905"}}},"execution_count":78,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["print(response_2)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"gjT7ryjX-DUp","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1771391807776,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":19,"user":{"displayName":"Shrutika Kapade","userId":"07496277854067889905"}},"outputId":"3caca30a-6456-4fed-88f9-044acd3e830a"},"execution_count":79,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Barnaby Button was not your average ten-year-old. While other kids were busy with video games and soccer practice, Barnaby was busy with maps. Not just any maps, mind you. He collected them, traced them, and dreamed of the places they represented. His bedroom walls were a tapestry of ancient cartography, a testament to his burning desire for adventure.\n","\n","One rainy Tuesday, while rummaging through his grandfather’s dusty attic, Barnaby stumbled upon a peculiar rolled-up parchment tucked away in an old sea chest. It wasn't a map of any place he recognized. Instead, it was a series of intricate drawings, strange symbols, and a single, faded inscription in a language he couldn't decipher.\n","\n","\"What in the world is this?\" he muttered, his heart thrumming with a familiar excitement.\n","\n","He spent days poring over the parchment, comparing the symbols to ancient alphabets he found in his books. Finally, a breakthrough! The symbols weren't letters, but a code. And the inscription, once deciphered, read:\n","\n","\"Where the Whispering Willow weeps, and the Sunstone sleeps, lies the entrance to the forgotten deep.\"\n","\n","The Whispering Willow! Barnaby knew that place. It was a massive, ancient willow tree in the heart of Blackwood Forest, a place whispered about in hushed tones by the townsfolk, a place said to be enchanted. And the Sunstone? He’d heard tales of a legendary gem, lost for centuries, rumored to glow with an inner light.\n","\n","His adventure had begun.\n","\n","The next morning, with a knapsack packed with essentials – a compass, a magnifying glass, a sturdy rope, and a very large sandwich – Barnaby set off for Blackwood Forest. The air grew cooler as he ventured deeper, the sunlight dappled through the thick canopy of leaves. The usual chirping of birds seemed to fade, replaced by an eerie silence.\n","\n","He found the Whispering Willow easily. Its branches, thick and gnarled, drooped like weeping arms, and a gentle breeze rustled its leaves, creating a soft, melancholic sigh. Barnaby scanned the ground around its trunk, searching for any sign of the Sunstone. He found nothing but moss and fallen leaves.\n","\n","Disappointed, he sat down, leaning against the ancient trunk. As he did, his hand brushed against a rough patch of bark. He looked closer. It was a carving, almost hidden by the moss, matching one of the symbols on his parchment!\n","\n","He traced the carving, his fingers following the lines. Suddenly, with a low groan, a section of the willow’s trunk swung inwards, revealing a dark, narrow opening.\n","\n","\"The entrance to the forgotten deep!\" Barnaby exclaimed, his eyes wide with wonder.\n","\n","He didn't hesitate. With a deep breath, he stepped into the darkness, his heart pounding a rhythm of pure adventure. The passage was damp and smelled of earth and ancient secrets. He used his compass to navigate, the beam of his flashlight cutting through the gloom.\n","\n","The passage led him to a vast cavern. Stalactites hung like icy teeth from the ceiling, and the air was thick with a strange, ethereal glow. In the center of the cavern, resting on a pedestal of smooth, dark stone, was a gem. It pulsed with a soft, warm light, just as the legends described. The Sunstone.\n","\n","But as Barnaby approached, a low growl echoed from the shadows. Two glowing eyes appeared, then another pair, and another. A pack of shadow wolves, their fur the color of midnight, emerged from the darkness, their fangs bared.\n","\n","Barnaby’s blood ran cold. He was trapped. He clutched his magnifying glass, his mind racing. He remembered a detail from one of his grandfather’s old books about legends of the forest: shadow wolves were creatures of darkness, and light was their weakness.\n","\n","He quickly unrolled his parchment. The symbols! He remembered another inscription he’d deciphered: \"The Sunstone’s light, when amplified, repels the night.\"\n","\n","Barnaby grabbed the Sunstone. It was surprisingly warm in his hands. He held it up, its light shining brightly, but it wasn't enough. The wolves crept closer, their growls intensifying.\n","\n","Then, he had an idea. He remembered the magnifying glass in his knapsack. He pulled it out, positioning it between the Sunstone and the approaching wolves. He adjusted the angle, focusing the Sunstone’s light through the glass, creating a beam of intense, concentrated light.\n","\n","The wolves recoiled, yelping as the amplified light struck them. They couldn't bear it. With a final, mournful howl, they turned and melted back into the shadows from which they came.\n","\n","Barnaby let out a shaky breath, his legs feeling like jelly. He had done it. He had faced the creatures of the dark and emerged victorious, all thanks to his wits and a little bit of ancient magic.\n","\n","He carefully placed the Sunstone back on its pedestal. He knew it belonged there, a guardian of the forgotten deep. His adventure had been more than he could have ever imagined.\n","\n","As Barnaby made his way back through the passage, the Whispering Willow seemed to sigh a little louder, a sound of approval. Emerging into the dappled sunlight of Blackwood Forest, he felt a sense of accomplishment that no video game could ever provide. He was Barnaby Button, the boy who had followed a map of symbols, found a legendary gem, and outsmarted shadow wolves. And he knew, with a certainty that warmed him like the Sunstone itself, that this was just the beginning of his grand adventures.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Whenever we are accessing a single model components (use invoke) dont need to pass dictionary as a variable data.\n","# But whenever we are using runnables sequence at that time, if we want to pass multiple input, then we use dictionary because it acts like this =\n","# sequential_chain_2.invoke(input = {\"genre\":\"Adventure\",\"years\":10})"],"metadata":{"id":"sUx_PPh--DR6","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1771391807776,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":5,"user":{"displayName":"Shrutika Kapade","userId":"07496277854067889905"}}},"execution_count":80,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### One condition :\n","\n","If we pass an extra variable like \"x\": 10 in :\n","sequential_chain_2.invoke({\"genre\":\"Adventure\",\"years\":10,\"x\":10})\n","#### and \"x\" is not used in the prompt template, it will not give an error.\n","\n","- LangChain simply ignores the extra variable by default and only uses the variables that are defined in the prompt template.\n","\n","- So unused inputs are automatically skipped."],"metadata":{"id":"RH7jYvzZHSzu"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Problem statement:\n","\n","LLM Workflow:\n","\n","- Use the LLM to generate a story based on given inputs (e.g., genre, theme, years).\n","\n","- Pass the generated story as input to the same or another LLM.\n","\n","- The LLM analyzes the story and provides a rating (e.g., out of 10) based on quality, creativity, and coherence.\n","\n","Simple Flow:\n","LLM → Generate Story → Pass Story → LLM → Give Rating"],"metadata":{"id":"KPMHPm9jInzT"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# chatpromptTemplate_1 --> LLM --> story --> outputparser --> story --> chatpromptTemplate_2 --> LLM --> ratings"],"metadata":{"id":"xuwRaBi4-DPM","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1771391807777,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":4,"user":{"displayName":"Shrutika Kapade","userId":"07496277854067889905"}}},"execution_count":81,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Create Prompt_Template for (creating a story)\n","cpt_1 = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(\"You are having a {years} years of experience in writing and generating a story for children's\"),\n","                                  HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(\"Based on this genre: {genre} generate a story\")])\n","\n","# Create Prompt_Template for (to generate ratings)\n","cpt_2 = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(\"You are having a 10 years of experience in giving ratings on a story\"),\n","                                  HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(\"Based on this story: {story} rate it out of 5 where 5 is the best and 1 is the worst \")])"],"metadata":{"id":"KyUWlqkwQIoa","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1771391807777,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":3,"user":{"displayName":"Shrutika Kapade","userId":"07496277854067889905"}}},"execution_count":82,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# (years,genre) 2_input_variable-->ChatPromptTemplate[runn_cpt_1]:Prompt-->LLM--return[AI message]-->StringOutputParser-->Return[Text] NEXT👇\n","# Return[Text] go as -->(Story) 1_input_variable-->ChatPromptTemplate[runn_cpt_2]:Prompt-->LLM--return[AI message]-->StringOutputParser-->rating"],"metadata":{"id":"UDIAVy7JQIlC","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1771391807793,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":7,"user":{"displayName":"Shrutika Kapade","userId":"07496277854067889905"}}},"execution_count":83,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from google.colab import userdata\n","gem_lite = userdata.get('gemini_lite')\n","\n","import os\n","os.environ[\"GOOGLE_API_KEY\"] =gem_lite\n","# We have setuped the environment variable for accessing gemini models"],"metadata":{"id":"Wq_f439FL-FE","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1771391938025,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":755,"user":{"displayName":"Shrutika Kapade","userId":"07496277854067889905"}}},"execution_count":88,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Step 2 = Set LLM Model\n","model = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(model = \"gemini-2.5-flash-lite\")"],"metadata":{"id":"u0n8YWzxMEn_","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1771391965072,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":172,"user":{"displayName":"Shrutika Kapade","userId":"07496277854067889905"}}},"execution_count":89,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["seq_chain_1 = cpt_1|model|runn3_strp|cpt_2|model|runn3_strp #

His imaginative nature and thirst for adventure make him the perfect hero for this kind of tale. The contrast with his peers is a nice touch that grounds him in childhood reality.\n","*   **Magical Premise:** The discovery of the \"Whispering Feather\" is a classic and effective fantasy trope. The immediate transportation to the jungle is a great hook that propels the story forward with excitement.\n","*   **Clear and Satisfying Plot Arc:** The story follows a classic adventure structure: discovery, journey, challenges, and reward. Each element is present and well-executed.\n","*   **Creative Challenges:** The monkey encounter and the river crossing are age-appropriate and clever challenges that Barnaby overcomes through kindness and observation, reinforcing positive values.\n","*   **Meaningful Treasure:** The \"treasure\" being ancient maps and explorer journals is a wonderful twist. It emphasizes the value of knowledge, imagination, and future adventures over material wealth, which is a beautiful message.\n","*   **Strong Theme:** The overarching theme that \"the greatest treasure was the journey itself\" is beautifully conveyed and leaves a lasting, positive impression.\n","*   **Vivid Imagery:** The descriptions of the jungle, the feather's glow, and the sunset are evocative and help the reader immerse themselves in Barnaby's world.\n","*   **Satisfying Conclusion:** The ending feels earned and inspiring, clearly signaling that this is just the beginning of Barnaby's grand adventures.\n","\n","**Areas for slight improvement (why not a perfect 5):**\n","\n","*   **Pacing:** While generally good, the transition from the attic to the jungle is very abrupt. A slightly more gradual shift might add a touch more wonder.\n","*   **Originality:** The core elements (magical artifact, jungle adventure, hidden treasure) are well-executed but lean on established fantasy tropes. While this isn't a bad thing for the target audience, a slightly more unique twist could elevate it further.\n","\n","Overall, this is a delightful story that sparks the imagination and delivers a heartwarming message.

The well\\'s description as \"bottomless\" and the ensuing magical elements are well-integrated.\\n\\n*   **Theme and Message (5/5):** This is where the story truly shines. The message that \"adventure wasn\\'t always about what you found, but about the journey, the mystery, and the magic that waited in the most unexpected places\" is beautifully conveyed. The ending reinforces this perfectly, leaving the reader with a warm, hopeful feeling. The inscription \"For those who seek wonder\" is a perfect encapsulation of the story\\'s core.\\n\\n*   **Originality and Creativity (4/5):** While the premise of a child finding a mysterious object and going on an adventure is common, the execution here is fresh. The locket as a \"key\" that doesn\\'t unlock a physical door but leads to a magical encounter with a hummingbird is a creative twist. The gradual reveal of magic, rather than an immediate fantastical element, builds suspense effectively.\\n\\n*   **Writing Style and Language (4.5/5):** The prose is clear, engaging, and age-appropriate. The use of descriptive language (\"knobbly knees,\" \"tarnished brass locket,\" \"iridescent glow\") paints vivid pictures. The dialogue is natural, and Barnaby\\'s internal thoughts feel authentic to a child\\'s perspective.\\n\\n**Areas for slight improvement (which prevent a perfect 5/5):**\\n\\n*   **The \"click\" at the oak tree:** While it adds a moment of anticipation, it could have been slightly more impactful or led to a more tangible (even if small) clue to justify the locket\\'s purpose there. However, its lack of a direct effect also serves to guide Barnaby to the well.\\n*   **The well\\'s wind:** The gust of wind that takes the locket feels a *tiny* bit like a convenient plot device. While it serves its purpose, a slightly more organic transition might have been even stronger.\\n\\n**Overall:**\\n\\nThis is a beautifully crafted children\\'s story that captures the spirit of childhood wonder and the thrill of discovery. It’s the kind of story that stays with you, encouraging readers to look for magic in their own everyday lives. Barnaby is a character I\\'d love to read more about.

Here\\'s my rating based on my experience:\\n\\n**Rating: 4.5 out of 5**\\n\\nHere\\'s a breakdown of why:\\n\\n**Strengths:**\\n\\n*   **Imaginative Protagonist:** Barnaby is a wonderfully conceived character. His passion for maps, especially unusual ones, is unique and engaging for a ten-year-old. This immediately sets him apart and makes him relatable to anyone who has had a strong, quirky interest.\\n*   **Captivating Premise:** The \"Whispering Isle\" concept is immediately intriguing. The idea of a map leading to a place that communicates through sound is a fantastic hook.\\n*   **Charming Sidekick:** Professor Wigglesworth is the perfect companion. His \"portly\" nature and talent for sniffing out snacks and trouble add humor and a touch of groundedness to Barnaby\\'s fantastical quest. His \"woof\" of readiness is a great touch.\\n*   **Well-Paced Adventure:** The story moves at a good pace. We get Barnaby\\'s initial discovery, his persuasive approach to his parents (which is handled realistically and humorously), the exciting journey, and the eventual arrival and discovery on the island.\\n*   **Evocative Descriptions:** The author does a great job of creating vivid imagery. Phrases like \"old, crinkly, slightly-smelling-of-dust maps,\" \"faded parchment,\" \"swirling ocean, a jagged coastline,\" \"dense, emerald-green jungle,\" and \"moss that glowed with a soft, ethereal light\" really bring the world to life.\\n*   **Meaningful Resolution:** The \"treasure\" Barnaby finds isn\\'t material wealth, but a deeper connection to nature and a sense of wonder. This is a beautiful and mature theme for a children\\'s story. The \"language of the island\" is a lovely metaphor.\\n*   **Satisfying Ending:** The journey home and Barnaby\\'s changed perspective provide a strong sense of closure and anticipation for future adventures.\\n\\n**Areas for Minor Improvement (that prevent a perfect 5):**\\n\\n*   **Parental Agreement:** While the parents\\' agreement is a necessary plot point, it feels *slightly* too easy. A little more gentle persuasion or a slightly more detailed negotiation might have added a touch more realism, even within the fantasy. However, for a story of this nature, it\\'s a minor quibble.\\n*   **The \"Whispering\":** While the concept is great, the actual \"language\" of the island is described as speaking of \"peace, of growth, of the interconnectedness of all living things.\" This is lovely, but a *tiny* bit more specific detail about what the whispers *sounded* like, beyond a \"soft, melodic humming,\" might have made the experience even more immersive. For example, were they like gentle chimes, rustling leaves in a specific rhythm, or something else?\\n\\n**Overall:**\\n\\nThis is a wonderfully crafted children\\'s adventure story. It\\'s imaginative, heartwarming, and has a positive message. Barnaby is a character readers will root for, and the Whispering Isle is a place they\\'ll wish they could visit. It\\'s a story that sparks imagination and celebrates the joy of discovery.

Barnaby's adventures were usually much smaller, and much more… ordinary.\\n\\nOne sunny Tuesday morning, Barnaby woke with a tingle in his toes. Today, he declared to his teddy bear, Professor Snuggles, was the day he would conquer the Great Unknown. The Great Unknown, in Barnaby's world, was the mysterious patch of overgrown weeds at the very back of his garden, a place his mum always told him to stay away from.\\n\\nHe pulled on his trusty explorer boots (wellington boots, really) and his brave knight helmet (a colander). Professor Snuggles, tucked safely into Barnaby's backpack, gave a silent nod of encouragement.\\n\\nCreeping out the back door, Barnaby surveyed his mission. The Great Unknown loomed before him, a jungle of towering dandelions and whispering grass. His heart thumped like a drum. What wonders lay hidden within?\\n\\nWith a deep breath, Barnaby plunged in. The grass tickled his knees, and the leaves rustled like secrets. He imagined himself a mighty explorer, hacking through dense foliage with his trusty stick-sword.\\n\\nSuddenly, he heard a tiny squeak! Barnaby froze. Was it a fearsome beast? He cautiously parted a giant dandelion leaf.\\n\\nThere, nestled amongst the roots, was a tiny, fluffy creature. It had big, curious eyes and wobbly legs. It was a baby bunny!\\n\\nThe bunny looked just as surprised to see Barnaby as Barnaby was to see it. It twitched its nose and then, with a hop, disappeared into the undergrowth.\\n\\nBarnaby's adventure had just gotten more exciting. He decided he had to find the bunny's mama. He followed the faint rustling sounds, his explorer senses tingling. He discovered a shimmering ladybug, its shell like a polished ruby. He saw a busy ant carrying a crumb twice its size, a miniature strongman. He even found a patch of the brightest bluebells he'd ever seen, like tiny bells waiting to be rung.\\n\\nAfter what felt like hours, Barnaby heard a soft thumping sound. He crept closer and peeked through a thicket of brambles. And there, by a large, mossy stone, was a mother rabbit, her ears twitching, and beside her, a little ball of fluff – the baby bunny he'd seen!\\n\\nBarnaby watched, a huge smile spreading across his face. He had found the lost bunny and helped it find its way home. His adventure in the Great Unknown was a success!\\n\\nAs the sun began to dip below the garden fence, Barnaby emerged from the weeds, his boots a little muddy and his colander helmet slightly askew. He felt like a true adventurer, having discovered not dragons or gold, but the wonder of the natural world right in his own backyard.

The most exciting thing that happened was when Mrs. Higgins\\' cat, Bartholomew, got stuck up the oak tree for the third time that month. But Barnaby dreamed of more. He dreamed of hidden treasures, of roaring beasts, and of lands painted with colors no one had ever seen.\\n\\nOne sun-drenched afternoon, while exploring the dusty attic of his grandmother’s house, Barnaby stumbled upon an old, leather-bound book. Its pages were brittle, and the ink had faded to a whisper, but the title, etched in gold that still gleamed faintly, read: \"The Chronicles of the Whispering Isles.\"\\n\\nAs Barnaby opened the book, a gust of wind, smelling of salt and something sweet like mangoes, swept through the attic, though all the windows were shut tight. The pages began to shimmer, and the words rearranged themselves, forming a map. It wasn\\'t a map of his town, or even his country. It was a map of islands, strange shapes floating on a swirling blue sea. And in the center, a giant, glittering X.\\n\\nHis heart did a triple somersault. This was it! An adventure!\\n\\nThe map showed a starting point: the \"Gnarled Oak of Sighs,\" a tree he knew well from the edge of the Whispering Woods, a place his mother always told him not to wander too far into. Clutching the book, Barnaby scrambled down from the attic, his ordinary world suddenly feeling a little less ordinary.\\n\\nHe packed a rucksack with a half-eaten apple, a compass his grandfather had given him (though he wasn’t entirely sure how to use it), and a sturdy stick he’d named \"Sir Reginald.\" He slipped out of the house, the sun still high in the sky, and headed towards the Whispering Woods.\\n\\nThe woods were usually a place of dappled sunlight and bird songs. But today, as he approached the Gnarled Oak, the air grew still. The leaves seemed to hold their breath. The oak itself was ancient, its branches twisted like arthritic fingers.\\n\\nFollowing the map, Barnaby found a small, moss-covered stone at the base of the tree. He pressed it, and to his astonishment, the stone sank inwards with a soft *click*. A hidden passage, cloaked in ivy, opened before him. It smelled of damp earth and something faintly metallic, like old coins.\\n\\nTaking a deep breath and gripping Sir Reginald, Barnaby stepped inside. The passage was dark, but a faint, phosphorescent glow emanated from the walls, guiding his way. He walked for what felt like hours, the only sound the echo of his own footsteps and the occasional drip of water.\\n\\nSuddenly, the passage opened into a vast cavern. The air here was warm and humid, and the walls sparkled with embedded crystals. In the center of the cavern, a shimmering portal pulsed with an otherworldly light. It looked like a doorway made of rainbows.\\n\\nThe map in the book now pointed directly at the portal. This was the gateway to the Whispering Isles. With a surge of excitement that made his toes tingle, Barnaby stepped through.\\n\\nHe blinked, his eyes adjusting to a blindingly bright, tropical sun. He was standing on a beach of sand so white it looked like powdered sugar. The sea was an impossible shade of turquoise, and strange, colorful birds with feathers like jewels flitted through the air, singing melodies he’d never heard.\\n\\nThis was the first of the Whispering Isles!\\n\\nHis map now showed a path leading inland, past a grove of trees that bore fruit shaped like tiny, glowing lanterns. As he walked, he heard a rustling in the bushes. His heart leaped into his throat. Was it a roaring beast?\\n\\nOut popped a creature unlike anything he’d ever imagined. It was small, furry, and had large, curious eyes. It also had six legs and a tail that wagged like a happy puppy’s. It chirped at him, a sound like tiny bells.\\n\\nBarnaby, remembering his manners, bowed slightly. \"Hello,\" he said. \"I\\'m Barnaby Button. Are you… a resident of the Whispering Isles?\"\\n\\nThe creature tilted its head, then scampered forward and nudged his hand with its soft nose. It seemed friendly. Barnaby decided to call him \"Sparky.\"\\n\\nSparky, it turned out, understood Barnaby perfectly, not through words, but through gestures and intuition. He led Barnaby deeper into the island, past waterfalls that cascaded with liquid moonlight and flowers that bloomed with music. They encountered giant, gentle lizards that wore crowns of flowers and tiny, mischievous sprites who loved to play hide-and-seek.\\n\\nThe map led them to the heart of the island, where a magnificent, ancient tree stood. Its trunk was as wide as his house, and its branches reached for the sky, laden with the glowing lantern-fruits. This was the \"Tree of Wishes,\" the map declared. And at its base, the glittering X.\\n\\nBarnaby’s heart pounded. He approached the tree, Sparky chattering excitedly beside him. He looked at the X, then at the book. The X wasn’t marking a treasure chest of gold, but something far more precious.\\n\\nHe closed his eyes and thought of his dream. He wished for more adventures, for the courage to explore the unknown, and for the joy of discovery. He touched the X, and a warm, golden light enveloped him.\\n\\nWhen he opened his eyes, the light faded. The Tree of Wishes stood before him, as grand as ever. He felt… different. Stronger, braver, and filled with a quiet confidence.\\n\\nSparky nudged him again, and Barnaby knew it was time to go. He thanked Sparky, promising to visit again, and with a final look at the magical island, he stepped back through the shimmering portal.\\n\\nHe found himself back in the cavern, the phosphorescent glow now a familiar friend. He retraced his steps, the passage seeming shorter now, and emerged from the Gnarled Oak just as the sun began to dip below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of orange and purple.\\n\\nHe ran home, the adventure still buzzing in his veins. His mother was calling him for supper, her voice a comforting sound. He looked down at his smudged knees, a proud smile on his face. The town might seem ordinary, but Barnaby Button knew that extraordinary adventures were just a dusty book and a brave heart away. And he knew, with a certainty that warmed him from the inside out, that this was just the beginning of his many journeys to the Whispering Isles.',\n"," 'exp': 20}"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":117}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["print(response_5.keys())"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"d7S2Nv-KPeJs","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1771392872741,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":20,"user":{"displayName":"Shrutika Kapade","userId":"07496277854067889905"}},"outputId":"0800dc8b-7495-4836-da00-4e3f451c0375"},"execution_count":118,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["dict_keys(['years', 'genre', 'story', 'exp'])\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"QUYznh25PeGR"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["Final_chain = RunnablePassthrough.assign(story=RunnableSequence(cpt_3,model,runn3_strp)) | RunnablePassthrough.assign(exp = lambda response:response_4[\"years\"]) | RunnableSequence(cpt_4,model,runn3_strp)"],"metadata":{"id":"_k3_W6TfPeDh","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1771393107564,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":5,"user":{"displayName":"Shrutika Kapade","userId":"07496277854067889905"}}},"execution_count":120,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["Final_response = Final_chain.invoke({\"years\":20,\"genre\":\"adventure\"})"],"metadata":{"id":"EXQpk77OPeA_","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1771393162227,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":13950,"user":{"displayName":"Shrutika Kapade","userId":"07496277854067889905"}}},"execution_count":121,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["print(Final_response)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"y-woQyKmPd-d","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1771393164028,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":19,"user":{"displayName":"Shrutika Kapade","userId":"07496277854067889905"}},"outputId":"4434b76e-6b2a-4115-f441-4ce439d13f28"},"execution_count":122,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["As an experienced reviewer of stories, I've had the pleasure of delving into countless narratives.

The anthropomorphized elements like the chattering squirrels and the silent butterfly add to the enchantment.\n","*   **Plot and Pacing (4/5):** The story follows a classic adventure structure: a call to action, a journey, a discovery, and a return. The pacing is good, allowing the reader to soak in the magical atmosphere without feeling rushed. The discovery of the Stone of Whispers and its subsequent revelation of the \"secrets of the forest\" is a satisfying climax.\n","*   **Theme and Message (5/5):** The overarching theme of listening to the world around you and finding adventure in the ordinary is a powerful and valuable message. The story subtly teaches the importance of observation, imagination, and the hidden wonders that exist if we just take the time to notice them. The idea that Barnaby keeps his adventure as a personal treasure is also a lovely touch.\n","*   **Writing Style and Tone (4.5/5):** The language is accessible and evocative, perfectly suited for a children's story. The tone is consistently whimsical and optimistic. The use of sensory details, like the crunch of the boots on the grass and the pulsing warmth of the stone, enhances the reader's experience.\n","\n","**What makes it a strong 4.5?**\n","\n","The story excels in its pure, unadulterated sense of wonder. It doesn't try to be overly complex; instead, it focuses on the magic of a child's mind and the simple joy of exploration. The \"whispers\" of the world are a beautifully metaphorical treasure, far more valuable than any material wealth.\n","\n","**Could it be a 5?**\n","\n","While excellent, a tiny bit more might have pushed it to a perfect score. Perhaps a slightly more active role for Professor Snuggles, or a more tangible interaction with the Guardian, could have added an extra layer. However, these are minor points in an otherwise delightful narrative.\n","\n","**In conclusion:** Barnaby Button's journey is a testament to the power of imagination. It's a story that will resonate with young readers and remind adults of the magic they might have forgotten. A truly delightful read!\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["Final_dict_output= RunnablePassthrough.assign(story=RunnableSequence(cpt_3,model,runn3_strp)) | RunnablePassthrough.assign(exp = lambda response:response_4[\"years\"]) | RunnablePassthrough.assign(output = cpt_4 | model | runn3_strp)"],"metadata":{"id":"yGqsGmdjPd7u","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1771393761771,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":14,"user":{"displayName":"Shrutika Kapade","userId":"07496277854067889905"}}},"execution_count":130,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["dict_Final_output = Final_dict_output.invoke({\"years\":20,\"genre\":\"adventure\"})"],"metadata":{"id":"fa-BX9QHPd5E","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1771393771771,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":8147,"user":{"displayName":"Shrutika Kapade","userId":"07496277854067889905"}}},"execution_count":131,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["dict_Final_output.keys()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"vTKEQcHhSgRB","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1771393771789,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":16,"user":{"displayName":"Shrutika Kapade","userId":"07496277854067889905"}},"outputId":"8d1c2838-e525-4d44-abfa-24fe31ef8b89"},"execution_count":132,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["dict_keys(['years', 'genre', 'story', 'exp', 'output'])"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":132}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["dict_Final_output"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"Xcr2kyBfSiWx","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1771393781776,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":17,"user":{"displayName":"Shrutika Kapade","userId":"07496277854067889905"}},"outputId":"30e1295c-85e8-426b-dd09-aabd12d4d6b9"},"execution_count":133,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["{'years': 20,\n"," 'genre': 'adventure',\n"," 'story': '## The Whispering Waterfall and the Lost Locket\\n\\nBarnaby Button was a boy whose pockets always seemed to be full of interesting things: smooth grey pebbles, a particularly shiny beetle wing, and sometimes, if he was lucky, a forgotten jellybean. Barnaby loved adventures, the kind that started with a hunch and ended with a discovery.\\n\\nOne sunny afternoon, while exploring the edge of the Whispering Woods, Barnaby heard a faint, tinkling sound. It was like tiny bells dancing on the wind, but it wasn\\'t coming from the trees. He followed the sound, pushing aside ferns as tall as his shoulders, his heart thumping with that familiar thrill of the unknown.\\n\\nThe tinkling grew louder, leading him deeper into the woods until he stumbled upon a small, moss-covered clearing. In the center, a tiny waterfall, no bigger than his outstretched arms, cascaded down smooth, grey rocks. And there, tangled in the delicate spray, was a beautiful, heart-shaped locket, glinting like a fallen star.\\n\\nBarnaby carefully reached out and plucked the locket from the water. It was made of a silvery metal, and etched onto its surface was a tiny, intricate picture of a soaring bird. When he opened it, he found not a picture of a person, but a miniature map, drawn with faint, shimmering ink. The map showed a winding path, marked with little drawings of acorns and mushrooms, leading to a place labeled with a single, sparkling dewdrop.\\n\\n\"Wow!\" Barnaby breathed, his eyes wide. This was an adventure! He knew he had to find out who the locket belonged to. He tucked the locket safely into his pocket, the tiny map now etched in his memory.\\n\\nThe next morning, with a packed lunch of cheese sandwiches and a bottle of fizzy lemonade, Barnaby set off. He followed the path from the locket’s map, his trusty compass (a gift from his Grandpa, who also loved adventures) pointing the way. He passed trees that looked like grumpy old men and bushes that whispered secrets as he brushed by them. He saw squirrels burying nuts with such serious faces, he almost asked them if they were planning a heist.\\n\\nAfter a long walk, the path led him to a clearing even more beautiful than the one with the waterfall. Wildflowers bloomed in every color imaginable, and the air hummed with the buzz of happy bees. In the very center of the clearing, resting on a bed of softest moss, was a small, wooden birdhouse, painted in the same silvery color as the locket.\\n\\nBarnaby approached cautiously. He didn\\'t want to scare anyone. He held up the locket. \"Hello?\" he called out softly.\\n\\nSuddenly, a tiny, fluttery sound came from inside the birdhouse. The little wooden door creaked open, and out hopped a robin, no bigger than Barnaby’s thumb. But this robin was no ordinary bird. It had a tiny, shimmering feather tucked behind its ear, and its eyes twinkled with intelligence.\\n\\n\"Oh, thank goodness!\" chirped the robin, its voice like the tinkling of bells. \"You found it! I thought it was lost forever!\"\\n\\nBarnaby was so surprised, he almost dropped his lemonade. \"You... you can talk?\"\\n\\nThe robin bobbed its head. \"Of course! My name is Pip. And that locket belonged to my grandmother. She lost it when she was trying to show me the way to the Crystal Cave, a place full of the most beautiful, sparkling dewdrop flowers.\"\\n\\nBarnaby’s heart leaped. \"The dewdrop! I saw it on the map!\"\\n\\nPip hopped excitedly. \"Oh, you\\'re the one! My grandmother always said the locket would lead a kind soul to the cave. Would you like to see it?\"\\n\\nBarnaby nodded eagerly. Pip, with a flap of its tiny wings, took to the air, Barnaby following on foot, guided by the memory of the locket\\'s map. They squeezed through narrow passages, climbed over smooth, round stones, and finally, they emerged into a cavern that shimmered with a thousand tiny lights.\\n\\nAnd there, all around them, were the most beautiful flowers Barnaby had ever seen. They were like tiny, perfect dewdrops, each one glowing with its own soft, internal light. The air was filled with a sweet, delicate fragrance.\\n\\nBarnaby looked at Pip, who was perched on a glowing flower, its tiny chest puffed out with pride. \"This is amazing, Pip!\"\\n\\n\"It is,\" Pip agreed. \"And it\\'s all thanks to you, Barnaby. You\\'re a true adventurer.\"\\n\\nBarnaby smiled, his heart full. He had found a lost treasure, made a new friend, and discovered a secret, magical place. As the sun began to dip below the horizon, painting the sky in shades of orange and purple, Barnaby knew this was an adventure he would never forget. And as he walked home, his pockets were still full of interesting things, but now, they also held the memory of a talking robin, a whispering waterfall, and the sparkling secret of the dewdrop flowers.',\n"," 'exp': 20,\n"," 'output': 'With 20 years of experience in evaluating stories, I\\'d rate \"The Whispering Waterfall and the Lost Locket\" a solid **4 out of 5 stars**.\\n\\nHere\\'s my breakdown:\\n\\n**Strengths:**\\n\\n*   **Charming Protagonist:** Barnaby Button is an immediately likable character. His love for \"interesting things\" and his innate sense of adventure make him relatable and engaging, especially for a younger audience. His curiosity is the perfect engine for the plot.\\n*   **Evocative Setting:** The descriptions of the Whispering Woods, the tiny waterfall, and especially the final clearing with the dewdrop flowers are beautifully rendered. They create a sense of wonder and magic that draws the reader in.\\n*   **Intriguing Mystery:** The discovery of the locket with its map is a classic and effective hook. It immediately sets up a quest and fuels Barnaby\\'s desire for discovery.\\n*   **Magical Element:** The talking robin, Pip, is a delightful and unexpected twist. It elevates the story beyond a simple treasure hunt into a more fantastical realm, and the interaction between Barnaby and Pip is heartwarming.\\n*   **Satisfying Resolution:** The discovery of the Crystal Cave and the \"dewdrop flowers\" provides a visually stunning and emotionally rewarding conclusion. The theme of kindness leading to discovery is also a positive message.\\n*   **Pacing:** The story moves at a good pace, with the initial discovery leading smoothly into the adventure, and the journey to the cave feeling well-developed without dragging.\\n\\n**Areas for Potential Improvement (Minor Points):**\\n\\n*   **Predictability:** While charming, the core \"lost item leads to a magical discovery\" trope is quite familiar. A slightly more unique twist on the map or the nature of the treasure could have pushed it to a 5.\\n*   **Depth of Character:** While Barnaby is likable, his character arc is relatively simple. More internal reflection or a moment of doubt could have added another layer. Similarly, Pip, while charming, is primarily a plot device.\\n\\n**Overall:**\\n\\nThis is a delightful and well-crafted short story. It successfully blends adventure, mystery, and a touch of magic, creating an experience that is both engaging and heartwarming. It would be particularly enjoyable for younger readers, but its evocative language and satisfying conclusion can be appreciated by all ages. The story fulfills its promise of adventure and leaves the reader with a sense of wonder. It\\'s a strong 4-star tale that comes very close to perfection.'}"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":133}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"S7FGY-rGTA6v"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
