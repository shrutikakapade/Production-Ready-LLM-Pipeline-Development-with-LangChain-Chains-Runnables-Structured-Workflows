Her ship, the *Sea Serpent*, a sturdy vessel with sails the color of a stormy sky, sliced through the turquoise waves of the Serpent’s Embrace, a notoriously treacherous stretch of ocean rumored to be the resting place of forgotten treasures and lurking leviathans.\\n\\nElara, captain of the *Sea Serpent* and a legend in her own right, gripped the ship’s wheel, her knuckles white. Her crew, a motley but loyal band of hardened sailors, moved with practiced efficiency, their faces etched with a mixture of anticipation and a healthy dose of fear. They were on the hunt for the Sunstone of Aethelgard, a mythical artifact said to grant unparalleled navigational abilities, a prize that would elevate Elara’s reputation from renowned pirate to undisputed queen of the seas.\\n\\nTheir journey had begun weeks ago, following a tattered, ink-stained map purchased from a shadowy dealer in the port of Port Royale. The map spoke of an island hidden beyond the \"Veil of Whispers,\" a perpetual fog bank that swallowed ships whole.\\n\\n\"Captain!\" A gruff voice cut through the wind. It was Torvin, her first mate, a man whose beard was as thick as a ship’s rope and whose loyalty was as unwavering as the stars. \"The fog bank, dead ahead!\"\\n\\nIndeed, a wall of opalescent mist loomed before them, shimmering with an eerie, unearthly light. The air grew heavy, the usual cheerful banter of the crew silenced by an unspoken tension. Elara’s heart hammered against her ribs. This was it. The point of no return.\\n\\n\"Steady as she goes, Torvin!\" Elara’s voice, though calm, carried the weight of command. \"Rig for silent running. No unnecessary noise. And keep your eyes peeled for any… unwelcome company.\"\\n\\nThe *Sea Serpent* glided into the Veil of Whispers. Visibility dropped to mere yards, the world outside their immediate surroundings vanishing into a milky abyss. Strange, disembodied whispers seemed to slither through the mist, disorienting and unsettling. Elara felt a primal urge to turn back, a whisper of doubt echoing in her mind, but the glint of the Sunstone, the promise of its power, burned brighter.\\n\\nHours crawled by. The whispers intensified, morphing into what sounded like the cries of lost souls. The compass spun wildly, rendered useless by some unseen force. Elara relied on instinct, on the feel of the currents, on the subtle shifts in the wind.\\n\\nSuddenly, a colossal shadow loomed in the fog, eclipsing what little light there was. A guttural roar, like the grinding of mountains, shook the *Sea Serpent*.\\n\\n\"Kraken!\" Torvin bellowed, his hand instinctively going to the hilt of his cutlass.\\n\\nTentacles, thick as tree trunks and covered in razor-sharp suckers, erupted from the mist, lashing out at the ship. The crew sprang into action, swords and harpoons flashing. Elara, her nimble fingers dancing on the wheel, maneuvered the *Sea Serpent* with breathtaking skill, dodging the monstrous appendages.\\n\\n\"To the port side! Evasive maneuvers!\" she roared, her voice a beacon of defiance.\\n\\nThe battle was fierce. The Kraken, a creature of nightmare, seemed determined to drag them to the ocean floor. But Elara and her crew fought with the ferocity of cornered lions. They hacked at tentacles, fired cannons into the churning water, and shouted curses at the monstrous beast.\\n\\nJust as despair began to creep in, a faint, golden glow pierced the fog. It pulsed with an inner light, drawing Elara’s gaze. The Sunstone. It was on a jagged, rocky outcrop, barely visible through the swirling mist.\\n\\n\"The island!\" Elara cried, her voice hoarse. \"Torvin, full speed towards the glow! We’ll use the beast as cover!\"\\n\\nWith a surge of adrenaline, the *Sea Serpent* surged forward, the Kraken momentarily disoriented by their sudden change in direction. They slammed against the rocky shore, the impact jarring but survivable.\\n\\n\"Elara! The stone!\" Torvin pointed a trembling finger.\\n\\nThe Sunstone, a gem the size of a man’s fist, pulsed with warmth, radiating an ethereal light that pushed back the oppressive fog. Elara scrambled ashore, her crew following close behind. The Kraken, momentarily thwarted, thrashed in the water below, its roars echoing their frustration.\\n\\nElara reached for the Sunstone. As her fingers brushed its smooth surface, a jolt of pure energy coursed through her. The whispers in the fog abruptly ceased. The churning water calmed. And then, as if a curtain had been drawn, the Veil of Whispers parted, revealing a crystal-clear sky and the endless expanse of the ocean.\\n\\nHolding the Sunstone aloft, Elara felt an undeniable connection to the sea, a profound understanding of its currents and its moods. The map had been true. The legends were real.\\n\\nAs the *Sea Serpent* sailed away from the now-revealed island, the Kraken a distant, defeated shadow, Elara knew her adventure had just begun. With the Sunstone of Aethelgard in her possession, she was no longer just a captain; she was a navigator of destiny, ready to chart courses no one had ever dared to dream of.

She squinted, her gaze fixed on the jagged peaks of the Serpent’s Tooth mountains, a formidable barrier rumored to guard the entrance to the Sunken City. For weeks, she’d followed whispers and fragmented maps, driven by a legend of an artifact said to hold the lost knowledge of the Ancients, a power that could heal the blight slowly consuming her homeland.\\n\\nHer companion, a grizzled, one-eyed dwarf named Borin, grunted beside her, his breath pluming in the frigid air. \"You sure about this, lass? Those peaks ain\\'t for the faint of heart. And the stories about what lies beyond...\" He trailed off, his one good eye scanning the treacherous slopes.\\n\\nElara’s jaw tightened. “The blight is spreading, Borin. My village is dying. If the Sunken City holds the key, I have to try.” Her voice, though strained by the altitude, held a steely resolve that had seen them through countless perilous journeys.\\n\\nTheir trek through the mountains was a brutal ballet of survival. They navigated treacherous scree slopes, clung to icy cliffs, and battled blizzards that threatened to bury them alive. Borin’s knowledge of the earth and his uncanny ability to find hidden paths saved them more times than Elara could count. He’d grumble about her recklessness, but his loyalty was as unyielding as the mountain stone.\\n\\nOne evening, huddled in a shallow cave, a chilling roar echoed from the darkness. A shadow, vast and winged, passed overhead. \"Gryphon,\" Borin whispered, his hand instinctively going to the hilt of his axe. “Nasty temper, those ones. Best to stay hidden.”\\n\\nThey emerged days later, battered and weary, at a precipice overlooking a vast, mist-shrouded valley. And there, nestled in the heart of the valley, was a sight that stole Elara’s breath. Not a city of stone, but a shimmering, ethereal metropolis submerged beneath a tranquil, crystal-clear lake. Towers of coral and bioluminescent flora pulsed with a soft, otherworldly light. This was the Sunken City.\\n\\nThe descent was as perilous as the ascent. They found a hidden, flooded tunnel, its entrance masked by a waterfall. Armed with Borin’s enchanted diving gear and Elara’s innate ability to hold her breath for unnerving lengths of time, they plunged into the icy depths.\\n\\nThe city was an alien world. Schools of iridescent fish darted through grand arches, and ancient statues, worn by centuries of water, guarded silent plazas. The air, surprisingly, was breathable within the city’s protective dome, a marvel of ancient engineering.\\n\\nTheir quest led them to the central temple, a colossal structure shaped like a coiled serpent. Inside, amidst a garden of phosphorescent plants, sat a pedestal. And upon it, a single, pulsating crystal, radiating warmth and a gentle hum of energy. The Heart of Aethel.\\n\\nAs Elara reached for it, the temple rumbled. The water outside churned, and a colossal, serpentine creature, its scales like polished obsidian, emerged from the depths. Its eyes, glowing with ancient malice, fixed on them.\\n\\n“The Guardian,” Borin breathed, drawing his axe. “The legends spoke of it.”\\n\\nElara knew this was the final trial. The artifact was not meant to be taken easily. With a surge of adrenaline, she lunged for the crystal. The Guardian’s massive head lunged, its jaws snapping inches from her face. Borin, with a roar, charged, his axe biting into one of the creature’s massive coils.\\n\\nThe fight was a desperate dance in the heart of the Sunken City. Elara dodged snapping jaws and flailing tentacles, her mind racing. She remembered a fragment of an inscription she’d seen in the temple: “Harmony unlocks the path.”\\n\\nInstead of fighting, Elara focused on the crystal, channeling her desperation and her hope for her dying land. She placed her hand on the pedestal, not to take, but to connect. She projected images of her village, of the wilting crops, of the despair in her people’s eyes.\\n\\nThe crystal pulsed brighter. The Guardian, momentarily stunned by this unexpected act, recoiled. The water around them began to shimmer, not with menace, but with a gentle, healing light. The creature, its ancient eyes filled with a strange understanding, slowly lowered its head.\\n\\nElara understood. The artifact wasn’t a weapon to be wielded, but a source of life, meant to be shared, not hoarded. She carefully lifted the Heart of Aethel. It felt warm and alive in her hands.\\n\\nTheir journey back was less of a struggle and more of a triumphant return. The biting wind of the Serpent’s Tooth mountains felt less hostile, and the sunlight, when it broke through the clouds, seemed to carry a promise.\\n\\nBack in her village, Elara placed the Heart of Aethel in the center of the dying fields. A wave of vibrant energy spread outwards, the blight receding like a tide. The wilting plants straightened, their leaves regaining their verdant hue. A murmur of awe rippled through the villagers, followed by a wave of joyous cheers.\\n\\nElara, standing beside Borin, watched her homeland begin to heal. The adventure had been fraught with danger, but the reward – the restoration of life – was more than she could have ever imagined. The Sunken City, and its guardian, had taught her a profound lesson: true power lay not in conquest, but in understanding and in the courage to share what truly matters.'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":51}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"q4mDhkUcIs_A"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Create a Pipeline using Chain"],"metadata":{"id":"UGQ4tUCC7zDZ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1770986339320,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":2,"user":{"displayName":"Shrutika Kapade","userId":"07496277854067889905"}}},"execution_count":14,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from langchain_classic.chains import LLMChain , SequentialChain\n","\n","# LLMChain : Create a single chain\n","# SequentialChain : To connect multiple chain we have SequentialChain\n"],"metadata":{"id":"DE8n5kye7zAp","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1770986339348,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":25,"user":{"displayName":"Shrutika Kapade","userId":"07496277854067889905"}}},"execution_count":15,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["chain = LLMChain(prompt = cpt, llm=model, output_parser=strp) #Workflow"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"N6PA4_rr7y95","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1770986339366,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":12,"user":{"displayName":"Shrutika Kapade","userId":"07496277854067889905"}},"outputId":"c61f72ff-08c0-4af3-8a8f-9039ddfc6a56"},"execution_count":16,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["/tmp/ipython-input-2108912370.py:1: LangChainDeprecationWarning: The class `LLMChain` was deprecated in LangChain 0.1.17 and will be removed in 1.0.

Below, the churning, grey sea gnawed at the base of the cliffs, a constant reminder of the perilous journey she’d undertaken. Her destination? The Whisperwind Isles, a place whispered about in hushed tones by seasoned sailors and dismissed as myth by most. But Elara, armed with a tattered, ancient map and an unyielding thirst for discovery, believed.\\n\\nHer quest was not for gold or glory, but for the Sunstone. Legend claimed it was a gem of immense power, capable of healing any ailment, and Elara’s younger sister, Lyra, lay wasting away from a creeping sickness that no physician could cure. The map, inherited from her eccentric explorer grandfather, showed a hidden cove on the largest of the Whisperwind Isles, marked with a symbol that resembled a stylized sun.\\n\\nDays blurred into a relentless cycle of battling storms, rationing meager supplies, and navigating by the stars. Her small, sturdy sloop, the ‘Sea Serpent,’ had weathered more than its share of fury, but Elara’s resolve remained as unyielding as the iron in her bones. Finally, through a thick, swirling mist that clung to the water like a shroud, the jagged peaks of the Whisperwind Isles pierced the horizon.\\n\\nThe largest island, as the map indicated, was a formidable sight. Towering cliffs, veiled in perpetual mist, rose sheer from the unforgiving waves. Elara circled the island for hours, her eyes scanning for any sign of the hidden cove. The wind howled through the rocky spires, carrying an eerie, almost melodic sound – the ‘whispers’ of the isles, she supposed.\\n\\nJust as despair began to creep in, a break in the mist revealed a narrow, almost invisible slit in the cliff face. It was barely wide enough for the Sea Serpent to pass through, and the waves crashed violently against the entrance. With a deep breath, Elara steered the sloop into the churning maw, her heart pounding a frantic rhythm against her ribs.\\n\\nThe passage opened into a vast, subterranean cavern, illuminated by a soft, ethereal glow emanating from phosphorescent moss clinging to the damp walls. The air was thick with the scent of salt and something ancient, something…magical. In the center of the cavern, nestled on a pedestal of smooth, dark stone, lay the object of her quest.\\n\\nIt wasn't a gem, not in the way she'd imagined. It was a sphere of pure, condensed sunlight, pulsing with a warmth that defied the chill of the cavern. It was the Sunstone. As Elara reached out to touch it, a low growl echoed from the shadows.\\n\\nFrom the darkness emerged a creature unlike any she had ever seen. It was a guardian, a beast of shadow and stone, with eyes that glowed like embers and claws that could tear through steel. Its form shifted and writhed, a terrifying manifestation of the island’s wild magic.\\n\\nFear, cold and sharp, pierced Elara’s resolve. But then, she thought of Lyra, of her sister’s fading smile, and a fierce determination surged through her. She wasn't a warrior, but she was an adventurer, and adventurers faced their fears head-on.\\n\\nDrawing her trusty dagger, a gift from her grandfather, Elara stood her ground. The guardian lunged, its roars shaking the cavern. Elara dodged, her movements quick and agile, fueled by desperation. She couldn’t defeat the creature with brute force, but she remembered another fragment of her grandfather’s tales – that these guardians were bound by ancient oaths, their power tied to the very essence of the island.\\n\\nInstead of attacking, Elara began to speak, her voice trembling but clear. She spoke of the Sunstone’s purpose, of the healing it could bring, and of the balance it represented. She spoke of her love for her sister, a pure and selfless motive. She appealed to the guardian’s ancient duty, not to destroy, but to protect.\\n\\nThe guardian faltered, its menacing growls softening into a low rumble. Its glowing eyes seemed to study her, searching her heart. Slowly, deliberately, it backed away, melting back into the shadows from which it came.\\n\\nWith trembling hands, Elara lifted the Sunstone. It was surprisingly light, warm to the touch, and pulsed with a gentle energy that filled her with hope. She knew her journey was far from over, that the return trip would be just as perilous, but now, she carried the light of the Sunstone. She carried the promise of healing, the hope of a brighter future for Lyra, and the undeniable thrill of an adventure that had tested her spirit and proven that even in the face of the impossible, courage and love could light the way.\""],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":18}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["chain1 = LLMChain(prompt = cpt, llm=model, output_parser=strp,output_key=\"story\")\n","#This line creates a chain that sends the prompt (cpt) to the model, formats the model’s response using strp, and saves the final output with the key \"story\"."],"metadata":{"id":"eg1KSJZfCM1J","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1770986343760,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":30,"user":{"displayName":"Shrutika Kapade","userId":"07496277854067889905"}}},"execution_count":19,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["- prompt = cpt → The prompt template that defines what input will be sent to the model.\n","\n","- llm = model → The language model that generates the response.\n","\n","- output_parser = strp → Formats or processes the model’s output (for example, converts it into a clean string).\n","\n","- output_key = \"story\" → The key name under which the final output will be stored in the result dictionary."],"metadata":{"id":"QVihk0ARVUcx"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["cpt1 = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(\"You are an expert educator with 10+ years of experience in creating thoughtful, engaging, and analytical questions based on stories.
